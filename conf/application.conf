# Secret key

# The secret key is used to secure cryptographics functions.
# If you deploy your application to several instances be sure to use the same key!

# The application languages
# ~~~~~
application.langs="en"

# Global object class
# ~~~~~
# Define the Global object class for this application.
# Default to Global in the root package.
# application.global=Global

# Router
# ~~~~~
# Define the Router object to use for this application.
# This router will be looked up first when the application is starting up,
# so make sure this is the entry point.
# Furthermore, it's assumed your route file is named properly.
# So for an application router like `my.application.Router`,
# you may need to define a router file `conf/my.application.routes`.
# Default to Routes in the root package (and conf/routes)
# application.router=my.application.Routes

# Database configuration
# ~~~~~
# You can declare as many datasources as you want.
# By convention, the default datasource is named `default`
#
db.default.driver=org.h2.Driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"
db.default.user=sa
db.default.password=""

# Evolutions
# ~~~~~
# You can disable evolutions if needed
# evolutionplugin=disabled

# Logger
# ~~~~~
# You can also configure logback (http://logback.qos.ch/),
# by providing an application-logger.xml file in the conf directory.

# Root logger:
logger.root=INFO

# Logger used by the framework:
logger.play=INFO

# Logger provided to your application:
logger.application=DEBUG

# Mailer
# ~~~~~~

#smtp.debug (defaults to no, to take effect you also need to set the log level to "DEBUG" for the application logger)
smtp.mock=yes // (defaults to no, will only log all the email properties instead of sending an email)
#smtp.timeout (defaults to 60s)
#smtp.connectiontimeout (defaults to 60s)
